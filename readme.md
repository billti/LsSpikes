# LsSpikes repository
### By Bill Ticehurst

This repo is for experimenting with various language service implementations.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. e.g.

Build back in the './src' folder in the main repo by running `tsc`.  Launch the web site with `npm start` and browse to http://localhost:3000.

If you have a TypeScript repo in a sibling folder (i.e. '../TypeScript'), you can update the local copy of 
TypeScript by running `npm run updatets`.
